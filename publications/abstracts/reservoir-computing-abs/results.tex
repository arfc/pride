\section{Results}

The hyperparameters of the \acrshort{ESN} used in Figure \ref{fig:ESN1} and
Figure \ref{fig:ESN2} were randomly assigned and therefore not optimized. In
spite of this, preliminary predictions track reasonably well with grid demand.
The current iteration shows a potentially
misleading relationship between accuracy and training length. By inspection,
Figure \ref{fig:ESN2} is more accurate but the comparison is unfair because
the two ESNs are predicting different time periods.
We also conducted a single grid search for the an optimal combination of
spectral radius ($\rho$) and noise injection (for regularization of reservoir
neurons), Figure \ref{fig:gridsearch}, following the recommendations from
\cite{lukosevicius_practical_2012}.
