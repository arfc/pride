	abstract = {Many dynamic factors influence nuclear reactor and fuel cycle economics. Costs drive the equation, but policies affecting electricity pricing also influence nuclear power revenues at a fundamental level. In current reactors and their associated fuel cycles, capital, operation, and maintenance costs increasingly dominate the economics of nuclear power.
Advanced reactor designs and fuel cycle choices can impact these costs both positively
and negatively. While fuel cycle advancements also impact fuel costs, this component has a relatively small impact on the overall cost of nuclear electricity production, particularly in comparison to capital costs. If advanced reactors can offer very high-temperature heat appropriate for industrial processing, natively couple with storage technologies, or can otherwise acheive load following behavior, then they may become more financially feasible than the current fleet.},

	abstract = {As the U.S. energy system evolves, the amount of electricity from variable-generation sources is likely to increase, which could result in additional times when electricity demand is lower than available production. Thus, purveyors of technologies that traditionally have provided base-load electricity—such as nuclear power plants—can explore new operating procedures to deal with the associated market signals. Concurrently, innovations in nuclear reactor design coupled with sophisticated control systems now allow for more complex apportionment of heat within an integrated system such as one linked to energy-intensive chemical processes. This paper explores one opportunity – nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems. These are defined as integrated facilities comprised of nuclear reactors, renewable energy generation, and industrial processes that can simultaneously address the need for grid flexibility, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and optimal use of investment capital. Six aspects of interaction (interconnections) between elements of nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems are identified: Thermal, electrical, chemical, hydrogen, mechanical, and information. Additionally, system-level aspects affect selection, design, and operation of this hybrid system type. Throughout the paper, gaps and research needs are identified to promote further exploration of the topic.},

Key economic figures of merit are evaluated under optimized and constant (i.e., time-invariant) operations to demonstrate the benefit of the optimization, which also suggests the economic viability of the considered {NHESs} under the proposed operations optimizer.

In this work, the development of an integrated power plant model is presented. This model is validated against steady-state data from a subcritical power plant with reheat and regenerative cycles. The coal-fired power plant model studied has nominal power generation of 605MW and efficiency of 38.3\%. Traditional, regulatory control architectures are incorporated into and tuned with the dynamic power plant model. Dynamic simulation shows that the plant model is stable for sudden changes in coal load, and the controllers are able to maintain the controlled variables at their set points. In this two-part publication, we present the complete workflow of data collection, model development and validation, control tuning, dynamic optimization formulation and solution, and supervisory control architecture for a coal-fired subcritical power plant. Part I focuses on elements of model development and analysis, illustrating the advantages of acausal, object-oriented modeling in power plant simulation. Part {II} illustrates the use of this model for efficiency optimization under transient part-load operation.},

Accordingly it is very important to collect {HRA} data from diverse sources as much as possible, which should be done based on a firm technical underpinning. In this regard, Park et al. proposed a novel framework that allows us to systematically calculate the number of task opportunities from the investigation reports reflecting the operation experience of domestic nuclear power plants [1]. In this study, based on the proposed framework, the nominal {HEPs} of 15 task types are quantified based on the number of task opportunities calculated from the 13 investigation reports stemming from diverse human errors. Although there are several limitations to be technically resolved, the results of this study are meaningful because we are able to take the first step in securing {HRA} data from investigation reports that reflect the operation experience of domestic {NPPs}.},

As the cost of sensors decreases while their power increases, distributed sensor networks become a more attractive option for implementation in power plants. In this work, we investi- gate the use of a distributed sensor network to achieve highly accurate measurements. We apply shaped rewards to local components and use a simple learning algorithm at each sen- sor in order to maximize those rewards. Our results show that the measurements from a sensor network trained us- ing shaped rewards are up to two orders of magnitude more accurate than a sensor network trained with a traditional global reward. Further, the algorithm proposed scales well to large networks, and is robust to measurement noise and sensor failures.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0048v1},
	doi = {10.1613/jair.1437},
	abstract = {In this paper, we confront the problem of applying reinforcement learning to
agents that perceive the environment through many sensors and that can perform
parallel actions using many actuators as is the case in complex autonomous
robots. We argue that reinforcement learning can only be successfully applied
to this case if strong assumptions are made on the characteristics of the
environment in which the learning is performed, so that the relevant sensor
readings and motor commands can be readily identified. The introduction of such
assumptions leads to strongly-biased learning systems that can eventually lose
the generality of traditional reinforcement-learning algorithms. In this line,
we observe that, in realistic situations, the reward received by the robot
depends only on a reduced subset of all the executed actions and that only a
reduced subset of the sensor inputs (possibly different in each situation and
for each action) are relevant to predict the reward. We formalize this property
in the so called 'categorizability assumption' and we present an algorithm that
takes advantage of the categorizability of the environment, allowing a decrease
in the learning time with respect to existing reinforcement-learning
algorithms. Results of the application of the algorithm to a couple of
simulated realistic-robotic problems (landmark-based navigation and the
six-legged robot gait generation) are reported to validate our approach and to
compare it to existing flat and generalization-based reinforcement-learning
approaches.},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, a number of reinforcement learning techniques have emerged, and different reinforcement learning-based applications have proliferated. However, such techniques tend to specialize in a particular field. This is an obstacle to their generalization and extrapolation to other areas. Besides, neither the reward-punishment (r-p) learning process nor the convergence of results is fast and efficient enough. To address these obstacles, this research proposes a general reinforcement learning model. This model is independent of input and output types and based on general bioinspired principles that help to speed up the learning process. The model is composed of a perception module based on sensors whose specific perceptions are mapped as perception patterns. In this manner, similar perceptions (even if perceived at different positions in the environment) are accounted for by the same perception pattern. Additionally, the model includes a procedure that statistically associates perception-action pattern pairs depending on the positive or negative results output by executing the respective action in response to a particular perception during the learning process. To do this, the model is fitted with a mechanism that reacts positively or negatively to particular sensory stimuli in order to rate results. The model is supplemented by an action module that can be configured depending on the maneuverability of each specific agent. The model has been applied in the air navigation domain, a field with strong safety restrictions, which led us to implement a simulated system equipped with the proposed model. Accordingly, the perception sensors were based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast ({ADS}-B) technology, which is described in this paper. The results were quite satisfactory, and it outperformed traditional methods existing in the literature with respect to learning reliability and efficiency.},

This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration.

	abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

	abstract = {Nuclear power plants are known as low carbon baseload electricity generating options, but can they become sufficiently flexible to follow the fluctuating demand economically? Small modular reactors, conceived to address the issues associated with large sized nuclear reactors such as safety, costs, and completion timeline, can offer some flexibility through modularity. However, there remain the questions of whether and how these advanced concepts could become commercially viable for load-following electricity production. From the perspective of integrated long-term energy planning and in a scenario-based approach, this study is conceived to evaluate the economic feasibility of flexible energy productions from two first-of-a-kind demonstration projects; namely a floating nuclear power plant {KLT}-40S in Russia and a high temperature reactor pebble-bed module or {HTR}-{PM} in China. Although both projects are solely designed for electric-application, this study proposes the evaluation of a load-following arrangement through the co-production of hydrogen and the integration of grid-connected battery energy storage systems. All scenarios are investigated using a conservative or a reasonable worst-case approach so as to contribute to setting the bottom line for future commercial deployment of small modular reactors. Findings suggest that small modular reactors can already be commercially deployed in the short-to mid-term, and there are opportunities for further cost reductions through technological innovation and economies of repeat project implementation.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to design valve opening compensators for the header steam pressure control system of a Multi-Reactor and Multi-Load Nuclear Power Plant ({MMNPP}) using the feedforward compensation decoupling method. The mathematical model of the {MMNPP} consisting of two small modular reactor units, a steam header and three steam consuming units, (two-to-three {MMNPP}) was developed, including a nonlinear point reactor core model with six-group delayed neutron, an once-through steam generator ({OTSG}) model based on the moving boundary concept and a lumped parameter header model. Then linearization method was applied to the header model to obtain the corresponding transfer function model based on which feedforward compensators for header outlet valves were designed and integrated into the header steam pressure control system. It has been demonstrated by numerical simulation results that the developed header steam pressure control system with valve opening compensators can alleviate the coupling effect among header outlet flowrates, leading to much safer and more stable operations of the {MMNPP} than the existing header steam pressure control system without valve opening compensators. The control strategy given in this paper can be extended to more complex {MMNPPs}.},

This paper develops a prospective approach to examine the solicitations that nuclear will have to face, for several scenarios. Results show that, with the penetration of renewable energy sources, the number of extreme nuclear power ramps and amplitudes variations increase, as well as the number of annually required shut-downs/start-ups events per reactor, even if the nuclear capacity was to be lowered.

	abstract = {Global energy consumption is expected to increase significantly due to the growth of the economy and population. The utilization of fossil resource, especially coal, will likely be constrained by carbon dioxide emissions, known to be the principal contributor to climate change. Therefore, the world is facing the challenge of how to utilize fossil resource without a large carbon footprint. In the present work, a nuclear–coal hybrid energy system is proposed as a potential solution to the aforementioned challenge. A high-carbon energy such as coal is integrated effectively with a low-carbon energy such as nuclear in a flexible and optimized manner, which is able to generate the chemicals and fuels with low carbon dioxide emissions. The nuclear–coal hybrid energy system is presented in this paper for the detailed analysis. In this case, the carbon resource required by the fuel syntheses and chemical production processes is mainly provided by coal while the hydrogen resource is derived from nuclear energy. Such integration can not only lead to a good balance between carbon and hydrogen, but also improve both energy and carbon efficiencies. More importantly, a significantly lower {CO}2 emission intensity is achieved. A systematic techno-economic model is established, and a scenario analysis is carried out on the hybrid system to assess the economic competitiveness based on the considerations of various types of externalities. It is found that with the rising carbon tax and coal price as well as the decreasing cost of nuclear energy, the hybrid energy system will become more and more economically competitive with the conventional option, which make it a potential viable solution for the future carbon-constrained world.},

	abstract = {Reservoir computers are a subset of neural networks that behave as a dynamical
system rather than a function. This makes reservoir computers uniquely suited to
solving problems that involve time series data, but how they do so is not well understood. This thesis covers the background and implementation of reservoir computers,
before discussing the effects of linear memory and nonlinear computational ability.
We use reservoir computers with either exclusively linear memory, a combination of
linear memory and nonlinear computational ability, or exclusively nonlinear computational ability. As a first task, we show that these reservoir computers can act as
observers for the Lorenz and R¨ossler chaotic systems, i.e. they are able to predict
unobserved dynamical variables of these systems. We find that while the reservoir
with a combination of linear memory and nonlinear computation usually performs
better as an observer, for some tasks either linear memory or nonlinear computation
is not necessary to accurately make inferences about the system. Next, the linear
and combination linear/nonlinear reservoirs were tasked with “learning” the Lorenz
or R¨ossler attractor. The combination reservoir was able to learn the attractors, but
the linear reservoir was not. Lastly, coupled map lattice dynamics were generated
experimentally and in silico, and used to see if reservoir computers with a nonlinear
activation function could function as observers for a dataset with spatial extent. We
found an optimized parameter set that enabled the reservoir computer to predict the
dynamics of the unobserved nodes of a 1D lattice when given the dynamics of a few
nodes within the lattice. We found that, in principle, the reservoir could also function
as an observer for a 2D lattice, though the spatiotemporal dynamics of our particular
2D lattice were too complex for any reservoir size we used.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of ⩾1 week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to long-term prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building’s schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network ({RNN}) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep {NN} to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building’s load profiles, the proposed {RNN} sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi-layered perceptron model.},

	abstract = {Ensuring sustainability demands more efficient energy management with minimized energy wastage. Therefore, the power grid of the future should provide an unprecedented level of flexibility in energy management. To that end, intelligent decision making requires accurate predictions of future energy demand/load, both at aggregate and individual site level. Thus, energy load forecasting have received increased attention in the recent past. However, it has proven to be a difficult problem. This paper presents a novel energy load forecasting methodology based on Deep Neural Networks, specifically, Long Short Term Memory ({LSTM}) algorithms. The presented work investigates two {LSTM} based architectures: 1) standard {LSTM} and 2) {LSTM}-based Sequence to Sequence (S2S) architecture. Both methods were implemented on a benchmark data set of electricity consumption data from one residential customer. Both architectures were trained and tested on one hour and one-minute time-step resolution datasets. Experimental results showed that the standard {LSTM} failed at one-minute resolution data while performing well in one-hour resolution data. It was shown that S2S architecture performed well on both datasets. Further, it was shown that the presented methods produced comparable results with the other deep learning methods for energy forecasting in literature.},

@report{clemmer_nuclear_2018,
	title = {The Nuclear Power Dilemma},
	abstract = {For decades, nuclear power has provided most of the
nation’s carbon-free electricity. However, the owners
have shut down many nuclear plants in the last five
years or announced plans to close them well before
their operating licenses expire, generating a discussion
among policymakers and regulators about the impact
of early retirements. The primary reasons for these
early closures are the economic challenges brought on
by cheap natural gas, diminished demand for
electricity, falling costs for renewable energy, rising
operating costs, and safety and performance problems.
The possibility that the nation will replace existing
nuclear plants with natural gas and coal rather than
low-carbon sources raises serious concerns about our
ability to achieve the deep cuts in carbon emissions
needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change.
 As of the end of 2017, 99 reactors at 60 power
plants provided 20 percent of {US} electricity
generation. The owners have retired six reactors at five
plants since 2013, slated seven reactors at five more
plants to retire over the next eight years, and
threatened to close five reactors at four more plants in
the next few years if they do not receive new financial
support.1
 In addition, Illinois, New Jersey, and New
York now provide financial support to keep 10 reactors at seven plants operating for at least 10 more years.
 The economic challenges facing nuclear plants are
part of a historic transition in the {US} electricity sector.
Over the last decade, natural gas generation and
renewable energy generation from wind and solar have
grown rapidly as their prices have fallen. Combined
with investments in energy efficiency, these energy
sources have largely replaced generation from retiring
coal plants, resulting in a 28 percent reduction in {US}
power-sector emissions of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) below
2005 levels in 2017. While nuclear power’s share of
electric power production has remained relatively flat
over the past decade, most analysts project that share
to decline in the future without additional financial or
policy support.
 The transition already has resulted in many
benefits, including lower electricity prices, technological innovation, a cleaner environment, and increased
customer control over energy use. However, in the
absence of national policy to reduce carbon emissions,
the transition has undervalued all types of low-carbon
sources of electricity and underpriced natural gas and
coal relative to their damage to the climate.
 The Union of Concerned Scientists ({UCS}) has
assessed the economic viability and performance of
most of the nuclear power plants operating in the
United States, analyzing which ones are most at risk of
early retirement and evaluating the main factors that
affect competitiveness. We also identified reactors that
have been safe, reliable performers and those with
troubled performance records. In addition, using a
national model of the electricity sector, {UCS} has
analyzed the impacts on the {US} electricity mix, {CO}2
emissions, and consumer electricity bills of three
scenarios for retiring nuclear plants early and two
scenarios based on the introduction of national policies
to reduce carbon emissions.},

	abstract = {Machine learning ({ML}) models, e.g., deep neural networks ({DNNs}), are vulnerable to adversarial examples: malicious inputs modified to yield erroneous model outputs, while appearing unmodified to human observers. Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted {DNN} with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the {DNN} to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target {DNN}, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target {DNN}. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassified by the targeted {DNN}. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a {DNN} hosted by {MetaMind}, an online deep learning {API}. We find that their {DNN} misclassifies 84.24\% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many {ML} techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19\% and 88.94\%. We also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder.},

economical and technically simple mode of operation. In this mode, power changes are limited to
frequency regulation for grid stability purposes and shutdowns for safety purposes.
However for countries with high nuclear shares or desiring to significantly increase renewable energy
sources, the question arises as to the ability of nuclear power plants to follow load on a regular basis,
including daily variations of the power demand.
This report considers the capability of nuclear power plants to follow load and the associated issues

“System effects of nuclear power”. It provided a detailed analysis of the technical and economic aspects of
load-following with nuclear power plants, and summarises the impact of load-following on the operational

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00851},
	abstract = {We propose a method to learn deep {ReLU}-based classifiers that are provably robust against norm-bounded adversarial perturbations on the training data. For previously unseen examples, the approach is guaranteed to detect all adversarial examples, though it may flag some non-adversarial examples as well. The basic idea is to consider a convex outer approximation of the set of activations reachable through a norm-bounded perturbation, and we develop a robust optimization procedure that minimizes the worst case loss over this outer region (via a linear program). Crucially, we show that the dual problem to this linear program can be represented itself as a deep network similar to the backpropagation network, leading to very efficient optimization approaches that produce guaranteed bounds on the robust loss. The end result is that by executing a few more forward and backward passes through a slightly modified version of the original network (though possibly with much larger batch sizes), we can learn a classifier that is provably robust to any norm-bounded adversarial attack. We illustrate the approach on a number of tasks to train classifiers with robust adversarial guarantees (e.g. for {MNIST}, we produce a convolutional classifier that provably has less than 5.8\% test error for any adversarial attack with bounded \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ norm less than \${\textbackslash}epsilon = 0.1\$), and code for all experiments in the paper is available at https://github.com/locuslab/convex\_adversarial.},

In this review, these quantifiers computed in a hierarchy of atmospheric models (coupled or not to an ocean) are analyzed, together with their local counterparts known as the local or finite-time Lyapunov exponents. It is shown in particular that the variability of the local Lyapunov exponents (corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov exponent) decreases when the model resolution increases. The dynamics of (finite-amplitude) initial condition errors in these models is also reviewed, and in general found to display a complicated growth far from the asymptotic estimates provided by the Lyapunov exponents. The implications of these results for operational (high resolution) atmospheric and climate modelling are also discussed.},

We quantify the relative prediction accuracy of these algorithms for the long-term forecasting of chaotic systems using as benchmarks the Lorenz-96 and the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky ({KS}) equations. We find that, when the full state dynamics are available for training, {RC} outperforms {BPTT} approaches in terms of predictive performance and in capturing of the long-term statistics, while at the same time requiring much less training time. However, in the case of reduced order data, large scale {RC} models can be unstable and more likely than the {BPTT} algorithms to diverge. In contrast, {RNNs} trained via {BPTT} show superior forecasting abilities and capture well the dynamics of reduced order systems. Furthermore, the present study quantifies for the first time the Lyapunov Spectrum of the {KS} equation with {BPTT}, achieving similar accuracy as {RC}.

Specifically, we attempt to utilize machine learning as the essential tool for integrating the use of past data into predictions. In order to facilitate scalability to the common scenario of interest where the spatiotemporally chaotic system is very large and complex, we propose combining two approaches: (i) a parallel machine learning prediction scheme and (ii) a hybrid technique for a composite prediction system composed of a knowledge-based component and a machine learning-based component. We demonstrate that not only can this method combining (i) and (ii) be scaled to give excellent performance for very large systems but also that the length of time series data needed to train our multiple, parallel machine learning components is dramatically less than that necessary without parallelization. Furthermore, considering cases where computational realization of the knowledge-based component does not resolve subgrid-scale processes, our scheme is able to use training data to incorporate the effect of the unresolved short-scale dynamics upon the resolved longer-scale dynamics (subgrid-scale closure).},

	abstract = {Among the various architectures of Recurrent Neural Networks, Echo State Networks ({ESNs}) emerged due to their simplified and inexpensive training procedure. These networks are known to be sensitive to the setting of hyper-parameters, which critically affect their behavior. Results show that their performance is usually maximized in a narrow region of hyper-parameter space called edge of criticality. Finding such a region requires searching in hyper-parameter space in a sensible way: hyper-parameter configurations marginally outside such a region might yield networks exhibiting fully developed chaos, hence producing unreliable computations. The performance gain due to optimizing hyper-parameters can be studied by considering the memory–nonlinearity trade-off, i.e., the fact that increasing the nonlinear behavior of the network degrades its ability to remember past inputs, and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a model of {ESNs} that eliminates critical dependence on hyper-parameters, resulting in networks that provably cannot enter a chaotic regime and, at the same time, denotes nonlinear behavior in phase space characterized by a large memory of past inputs, comparable to the one of linear networks. Our contribution is supported by experiments corroborating our theoretical findings, showing that the proposed model displays dynamics that are rich-enough to approximate many common nonlinear systems used for benchmarking.},

However, most time series have a multiscale structure, which a single-hidden-layer {RC} model may have diﬃculty capturing. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple projection-encoding hierarchical reservoir computing framework called Deep Projection-encoding Echo State Network ({DeePr}-{ESN}). The most distinctive feature of our model is its ability to learn multiscale dynamics through stacked {ESNs}, connected via subspace projections. Speciﬁcally, when an input time series is projected into the highdimensional echo-state space of a reservoir, a subsequent encoding layer (e.g., an autoencoder or {PCA}) projects the echo-state representations into a lower-dimensional feature space. These representations are the principal components of the echo-state representations, which removes the high frequency components of the representations. These can then be processed by another {ESN} through random connections. By using projection layers and encoding layers alternately, our {DeePr}-{ESN} can provide much more robust generalization performance than previous methods, and also fully takes advantage of the temporal kernel property of {ESNs} to encode the multiscale dynamics of time series. In our experiments, the {DeePr}-{ESNs} outperform both standard {ESNs} and existing hierarchical reservoir computing models on some artiﬁcial and real-world time series prediction tasks.},

This research quantifies the value of wind power forecasting improvements in the {IEEE} 118-bus test system as modified to emulate the generation mixes of Midcontinent, California, and New England independent system operator balancing authority areas. To measure the economic value, a commercially available production cost modeling tool was used to simulate the multitimescale unit commitment ({UC}) and economic dispatch process for calculating the cost savings and curtailment reductions. To measure the reliability improvements, an in-house tool, Flexible energy scheduling tool for integrating variable generation, was used to calculate the system's area control error and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Control Performance Standard 2. The approach allowed scientific reproducibility of results and cross validation of the tools. A total of 270 scenarios were evaluated to accommodate the variation of three factors: generation mix, wind penetration level, and wind forecasting improvements. The modified {IEEE} 118-bus systems utilized 1 year of data at multiple time scales, including the day-ahead {UC}, 4-h-ahead {UC}, and real-time dispatch. The value of improved wind power forecasting was found to be strongly tied to the conventional generation mix, existence of energy storage devices, and the penetration level of wind energy. The simulation results demonstrate that wind power forecasting brings clear benefits to power system operations.},

	abstract = {The value of day-ahead solar power forecasting improvements was analyzed by simulating the operation of the Independent System Operator – New England ({ISO}-{NE}) power system under a range of scenarios with varying solar power penetrations and solar power forecasting improvements. The results showed how the integration of solar power decreased operational electricity generation costs, by decreasing fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs, while decreasing start and shutdown costs of fossil fueled conventional generators. Solar power forecasting improvements changed the impacts that the uncertainty of solar power has on bulk power system operations; electricity generation from the fast start and lower efficiency power plants, ramping of all generators, start and shutdown costs, and solar power curtailment were all reduced. These impacts led to a reduction in overall operational electricity generation costs in the system that translates into an annual economic value for improving solar power forecasting.},

This paper provides a full description of an {ANN}-based model designed to predict short-term high-resolution (15-min intervals) micro-scale residential net load profiles. Since it seems especially relevant due to the specificity of local autocorrelations in load signal, in this paper we put stress on the systematic approach to feature selection in the context of lagged signal. We performed a case study of a real micro-neighbourhood comprising only 75 single-family houses. The obtained average prediction error was equivalent to 5.4 per cent of the maximal measured net load. The issues, i.e.: (1) the feasibility of micro-scale residential load forecasting taking into account renewable energy penetration, (2) the feasibility to predict net load with dense temporal resolution of 15 min, (3) the feature selection problem, (4) the proposed prosumption- and comparison-oriented prediction model key performance measure, could be of interest to engineers designing energy balancing systems for local smart grids.},

	abstract = {A microgrid system, be it connected to the utility grid or an independent system, usually consists of a mix of generation - renewable and non-renewable; loads - controllable or non-controllable and Energy Storage Systems ({ESSs}) such as batteries or flywheels. In order to determine how much power is utilized from the controllable resources such as {ESS}, diesel generators, micro-turbines or gas turbines, we first need to determine how much the demand is or how much the renewable energy sources are generating is which is accomplished using forecasting techniques. Due to the intermittent nature of renewable resources such as wind energy or solar energy, it is difficult to forecast wind power or solar power accurately. These forecasts are highly dependent on weather forecasts. It is evident that forecast of any data based on forecast of other parameters would lead to further inaccuracy, even if the relation between the inputs and output maybe predetermined through regression methods. Therefore, this paper illustrates an approach to use historical power data instead of numerical weather predictions to produce short-term forecast results. The concept is based on persistence method presented in [1]. This method uses the “today equals tomorrow” concept. From [2], we know that persistence technique produces results that are more accurate as compared to other forecasting techniques for a look-ahead time of 4-6 hours. Both [1] and [2] were based on wind power forecasting. In this paper, we investigate persistence method for short-term electrical demand, solar {PV} (Photovoltaic) power and wind power forecasting. Since the forecasts are dependent on historical averages of the data in the ‘near’ past, the accuracy is inversely proportional to the variation of power between the historical data and the actual data.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07870},
	abstract = {Classification of multivariate time series ({MTS}) has been tackled with a large variety of methodologies and applied to a wide range of scenarios. Reservoir Computing ({RC}) provides efficient tools to generate a vectorial, fixed-size representation of the {MTS} that can be further processed by standard classifiers. Despite their unrivaled training speed, {MTS} classifiers based on a standard {RC} architecture fail to achieve the same accuracy of fully trainable neural networks. In this paper we introduce the reservoir model space, an unsupervised approach based on {RC} to learn vectorial representations of {MTS}. Each {MTS} is encoded within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict a low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared to other {RC} methods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable computational performance, thanks to an intermediate dimensionality reduction procedure. As a second contribution we propose a modular {RC} framework for {MTS} classification, with an associated open-source Python library. The framework provides different modules to seamlessly implement advanced {RC} architectures. The architectures are compared to other {MTS} classifiers, including deep learning models and time series kernels. Results obtained on benchmark and real-world {MTS} datasets show that {RC} classifiers are dramatically faster and, when implemented using our proposed representation, also achieve superior classification accuracy.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08996},
	abstract = {It is a widely accepted fact that data representations intervene noticeably in machine learning tools. The more they are well defined the better the performance results are. Feature extraction-based methods such as autoencoders are conceived for finding more accurate data representations from the original ones. They efficiently perform on a specific task in terms of 1) high accuracy, 2) large short term memory and 3) low execution time. Echo State Network ({ESN}) is a recent specific kind of Recurrent Neural Network which presents very rich dynamics thanks to its reservoir-based hidden layer. It is widely used in dealing with complex non-linear problems and it has outperformed classical approaches in a number of tasks including regression, classification, etc. In this paper, the noticeable dynamism and the large memory provided by {ESN} and the strength of Autoencoders in feature extraction are gathered within an {ESN} Recurrent Autoencoder ({ESN}-{RAE}). In order to bring up sturdier alternative to conventional reservoir-based networks, not only single layer basic {ESN} is used as an autoencoder, but also Multi-Layer {ESN} ({ML}-{ESN}-{RAE}). The new features, once extracted from {ESN}'s hidden layer, are applied to classification tasks. The classification rates rise considerably compared to those obtained when applying the original data features. An accuracy-based comparison is performed between the proposed recurrent {AEs} and two variants of an {ELM} feed-forward {AEs} (Basic and {ML}) in both of noise free and noisy environments. The empirical study reveals the main contribution of recurrent connections in improving the classification performance results.},

It has lately become a vivid research field with numerous extensions of the basic idea, including reservoir adaptation, thus broadening the initial paradigm to using different methods for training the reservoir and the readout. This review systematically surveys both current ways of generating/adapting the reservoirs and training different types of readouts.
